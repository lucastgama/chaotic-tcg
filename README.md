# Chaotic TCG Project

## 📌 About

This project aims to recreate the **Chaotic Trading Card Game** as a digital version using Unity. It combines my childhood fondness for the Chaotic universe with practical programming studies, focusing on software development concepts like **clean code, project organization, and game logic implementation**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal is **educational** — improving programming skills while building something I'm passionate about. This project serves as a practical playground to apply **software engineering principles** in a game development context.

## 🔥 Current Features

- ✅ **Dynamic battle grid system** supporting various match formats (1v1, 3v3, 6v6, 10v10)
- ✅ **Tree-like formation layouts** for creature placement
- ✅ **Configurable grid spacing** and team positioning

## 🛠 Technical Focus Areas

- 🎮 **Unity game development patterns**
- 🏗 **Project structure and organization**
- 🎯 **Game logic implementation**
- 🧑‍💻 **Object-oriented programming in C#**
- 📏 **Clean code practices**

## 🚧 Development Status

This is an **ongoing hobby project** in early development. Features are being implemented **incrementally** as I learn and expand my understanding of both **game development** and the original **Chaotic TCG mechanics**.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- 🃏 **Card implementation system**
- ⚔ **Battle mechanics following Chaotic TCG rules**
- 🎨 **User interface for gameplay interactions**
- 🌀 **Creature abilities and effects**

## 🤝 Contributing
